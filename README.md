# Purpose #

I developed this toolkit to consolidate macros that I use in my
research and also to share my efforts with anyone interested, but in
particular to share with my fellow labmates and graduate students.  As
a disclaimer, not all macros are finished and some are very specific
and situational, so I encourage anyone to update the files for
readability, user-friendliness, flexibility, and parsimony.

# Installation and usage #

In order to use this repo, run the following shell and git commands
(this should run if using Git Bash or other git shell on Windows):

```
    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/lwjohnst86/sasToolkit.git
```

Then, include the following code into the top of your SAS file/script
and run it:

```
    filename macrolib '~/SAS/src/';
    options mautosource sasautos=(sasautos macrolib);
```

At this time, the `macro.sas` file will need to be sourced in the SAS
file/script, using this command:

```
    %inc '~/SAS/src/macros.sas';
```

# Version numbering and meaning #

# Documentations #

## HTML ##

Contains the documentations generated by DocItOut.  Use the
`index.html` file in the `doc/html/` as well as the parent folder to
view the documentation.

## PDF ##

# Contents #

There are two folders in this toolkit.

## `doc` folder: ##

The `doc` folder contains the documemtation for the macros.  So far, I
haven't found many documentation generators for SAS, one of which is
called DocItOut that is pretty good at generating html pages for
looking at the comments and parameters of the custom macros.  Open the
`index.html` file (in the parent directory) in a web browser (for
example, Firefox) to view the documentation.

I will likely be making some type of parser to generate a pdf of the
code documentation for those who would prefer viewing a pdf doc.

## `src` folder: ##

This folder contains all macro files.  The format to how the comments
are structured are important and need to be consistently adhered to in
order for DocItOut to work.  Please, if you plan to add to the macros
and submit a pull request, be consistent with the way the code is
structured (see below).

# Style guide for writing comments and code #

For writing comments, I based much of what I will be describing below
on `DocItOut.pdf` (found in the `doc/` folder).  In addition, I also
used the website
["How to write comments for the Javadoc tool"](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html),
which provides a more comprehensive documentation on how to write
comments that are similar to Java (SAS has similar syntax to Java).
For more reference on things to keep in mind when writing
code/documentations, see the files in the `doc/` folder. The file
`WritingCodeThatLasts.pdf` by Sandra Minjoe is an excellent resource
on practices and techniques to make code have greater longevity.  The
file `WritingMacros.pdf` (slides) by Patrick Breheny is a great
resource to learning how to learning how to write macros.  Also, I
have a few blog posts on my
[website](www.sciencestatisticsandlife.com) that go through
step-by-step on learning to do basic SAS macros, at least to get
started.

When writing up SAS macros, always include documentation.  To make it
quicker to type of formatted documentation, use the table below for
using "quick tags" that can be converted later.

| Quick tag                                 | Converted html tag |
|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| \`\`word (two backticks)                  | \<code\>           |
| word\`\` (two backticks)                  | \</code\>          |
| \\\\                                      | \<p\>              |
| \[word                                    | \<b\>              |
| word\]                                    | \</b\>             |
| ' \&' (space, then \& at the end of line) | \<br\>             |

Table: Quick tags to use when writing up SAS comment documentation,
which can be converted to the html tags by using the `sasQuickTags.sh`
in my [git `bin` repo](github.com/lwjohnst86/bin).  These html tags
are used by DocItOut when creating the documentation.

Code within the SAS macro should always be indented properly and a new
line should be started after the SAS semicolon ";" or if the code is
longer than 80 characters, whichever comes first.
