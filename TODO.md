# To do list #

* Develop a tool to convert SAS comments into a markdown document,
  also into a pdf.  It will need to also run through several files in
  the macro directory.
      * Include a TOC.
* Develop the README file more.  Get DocItOut to recognize README.md
  the same as it recognizes readme.txt.
* make a makefile to change name of readme from .txt to .md.
* have some way to produce an example documentation like in roxygen
