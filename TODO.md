# To do list #

* Develop a tool to convert SAS comments into a markdown document,
  also into a pdf.  It will need to also run through several files in
  the macro directory.
      * Include a TOC.
* Move the docitout doc dir to html doc.  Have another folder for pdfs
  and have the .md file in the parent doc folder.
* Develop the README file more.  Get DocItOut to recognize README.md
  the same as it recognizes readme.txt.
* Get rid of formats.sas file.  Incorporate the values into the raw dataset.
* make a makefile to change name of readme from .txt to .md.
