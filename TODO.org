* TASK LIST

*** TODO Create tool to convert SAS comments into md or pdf
    It will need to also run through several files in
    the macro directory. Include a TOC.

*** TODO Develop README file more.  
    Get DocItOut to recognize README.md the same as it recognizes
    readme.txt.
*** TODO Make a makefile to change name of readme from .txt to .md?
*** TODO Create way to produce example documentation like in roxygen 
*** TODO Develop a version numbering system
    e.g. with each change to a macro = to 0.01 and a new macro as 0.1,
    while major changes = 1 (maybe?)
    Or, better yet, how about + 1.0.0 for major changes, + 0.1.0 for
    new macros, and + 0.0.1 for edits to existing macros from past
    release points.
*** DONE Use a development branch vs a master branch 
    CLOSED: [2014-08-12 Tue 13:21]
    To have it more stable over time.
*** TODO Add command in output_data to create a output dir
