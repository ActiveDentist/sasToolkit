Contains all macro files that can be referenced or copied to the
relevant project folders.

<p>

These SAS files are currently being maintained by Luke.  Refer to the
GitHub repository for an up-to-date version of these SAS macro files.

Preferably, when using this macros, either reference them in their
original location (e.g. $HOME/SAS, or $HOME/Documents/SAS) or pasting
the macro files into the project directory (folder).  If the files are
to be pasted into the diretory (i.e. for modularity of your research
project), it would be best to change the permissions of the file to
`read-only`. This would ensure that the macro files outside of the
master location would not be modified and thus maintaining your sanity
(as multiple copies of the macro files is a nightmare to manage).
