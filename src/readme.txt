Contains all macro files that can be referenced or copied to the
relevant project folders.  The best way to use these files is to add
the directory to your SAS AUTOCALL library.  See the <code>README.pdf</code>
file in the <code>sasToolkit<code> folder.

These SAS files are currently being maintained by Luke W. Johnston.
Refer to the GitHub repository (github.com/lwjohnst86/sasToolkit) for
an up-to-date version of these SAS macro files.
<p>

Preferably, when using these macros, either reference them in their
original location (e.g. $HOME/sasToolkit, or
$HOME/Documents/sasToolkit, or C:\) or pasting the macro files into the
project directory.  If the files are to be pasted into the diretory
(i.e. for modularity of your research project), it would be best to
change the permissions of the file to <code>read-only<code>. This would ensure
that the macro files outside of the master location would not be
modified and thus maintaining your sanity (as multiple copies of the
macro files is a nightmare to manage).  The best bet is to use the
AUTOCALL facility in SAS.

<b>A note on terminology:</b><br>

directory = folder<br>

$HOME = your home user folder (such as /home/joe/ for Linux,
C:\Users\joe for Windows, /Users/joe for Mac)<br>

AUTOCALL library = please see the <code>README.pdf<code> in the
<code>sasToolkit<code> folder.
